# devtools

I'm in the middle of converting previous jQuery tools and/or scripts over to VUE.js solution for practice as I learn more about vue.js. This is an active code sample that may not be fully functionable in certain parts. But it's mostly functional. I do know that I've yet to address the form builder located on the main index.cfm. Hopefully, I'll get to that soon. Currently focused on the DB Tool. The backend functions on Coldfusion CFC components which mostly generate JSON data to be utilized on the front end.
